  - Independently alter the volume, pitch and playback speed of wav files and live mic audio.
  - Handles interacting with Morph Vox Pro to allow users to apply complex voice morphing to their microphone.
  - TTS voice narrates button press actions
  - Intelligent side tone (user can hear audio being outputed unless they are just outputting their own mic without any special effects applied)

The program is controlled using a IR controller shown below. This is achevied using an arduino device that detects button presses and forwards the information on to the user's main computer using USB serial.
